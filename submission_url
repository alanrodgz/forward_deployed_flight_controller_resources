1. Right now I’m really enjoying Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. I like how immersive hardcore mode is. I appreciate that I’m not overpowered at the beginning and have to actually work my way up. It makes every small victory feel earned.

2. I understand the role taxes play and why they matter. But I don’t think the U.S. government is spending them in the wisest way at the moment. It feels like a lot of that money could be used more effectively.

3. I can be a bit of a snob about coffee. When the timing is right, I’ll say Arabic coffee with spices is some of the best coffee you can have. But if I’m rushing out the door, I’ll drink whatever’s available, even instant coffee.

4. Something I started doing in college was using what I call a “study lamb.” It’s just a lamp, but whenever I turn it on, my brain knows it’s time to focus. It acts like a mental switch between relaxing and getting stuff done.

5. The balloon launched around March 14 and climbed smoothly to its target altitude without any major issues. It stayed stable for the first few weeks, which suggests it had an active control system adjusting ballast or venting gas. Around mid-April, it shot up in altitude, possibly from a large ballast release or environmental change. It got a little unstable but then settled at a higher cruising level. Through most of May, it remained steady again. Near the end of May and into early June, it began a slow descent. No major control actions were visible, which probably means the mission was coming to an end, either due to battery depletion or a planned shutdown. By June 3 or 4, telemetry cut out completely. The mission looks like it went as planned, with a clear arc: ascent, stable cruise, mid-flight adjustment, high-altitude cruise, and descent.
